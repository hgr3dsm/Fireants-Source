## What is FireANTS?

FireANTS Labs, Inc. is a US-based company that uses state-of-the-art 3D imaging and blockchain technologies to create customized virtual worlds, NFTs, Avatars, and cashless wagering via its proprietary API Payment Gateway. The initial market is Native American and other sovereign nations, cashless systems for casinos gaming. FireANTS expands everyone’s digital presence

### The company has six distinct areas from which to generate revenue:

 -   Utility for voting ID, patrons, government, public, and private systems.
 -   FireANTS Global API & Payment Gateway.
 -   FireANTS is currently the only company developing crypto for Native American tribes.
 -   System installation and service contract income.
 -   Metaverse — custom creation, rental, advertising, and royalty income.
 -   NFT ID cards and other NFT income (such as avatars and virtual spaces).

> [!INOTE]
>  Our cryptocurrency trades on several exchanges and in the future will, hopefully, support our continued development of Tribal ID, Player Loyalty Programs, and Cashless Wagering systems.
